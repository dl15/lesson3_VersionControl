            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is having one main repository for all of the project files. Using various version control systems is very popular in the software development industry. Version control itself is beneficial when working on massive projects with several individuals. Team members are able to check files out, revise some code, and then check them back in by committing the code. If version control was not created, then individuals would have to exchange versions of their code. This could become a huge issue if working with more than one individual on a project, which usually tends to be the case. It is imperative to get experience using version control since it is used across all industries in software development.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an open source distributed version control system (VCS). It is free to the public and designed to handle both small and large project in an efficient manner. It is also known for its functionality and ease of use. Git also has some proactive features like preventing an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. There are three basic GIT commands when using the VCS. These commands consist of Add, Commit, and Push. Although there are other version control systems, learning how to use Git will be beneficial since it is the most popular and known for being better than other systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System (VCS) allows a team to simultaneously work on the same project while being able to commit their respective code or even revert back to an old version of their code. This solves the file sharing problem because using a version control system (VCS) automatically notes who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and being able to merge changes to the same file. Another benefit to using a VCS even if an individual is working on his or her own is that one can save their work on the system without the fear of losing it or having to start the project over.

                <span class="text-muted">Cloning an Existing Repository in Git </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It is very beneficial to clone an existing repository if an individual wants to get a copy of a project. There are a lot of open-source projects on Github that allow any developers to contribute to the project, use it for their own purpose, or even revise it to their liking. The specific command for cloning a project is “git clone.” Depending on the version control system, it may be “checkout” instead of “clone,” but both essentially mean the same thing. When an individual uses git clone to copy a project, they get very version of every file for the history of the project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is known for the single largest host for Git repositories since it is a great resource for collaboration of millions of developers and projects. Initially, a developer has to set up a free account by visiting www.github.com. Once the account is made, SSH (Secure Shell) access is needed to connect with Git repositories using the https:// protocol. This is authenticated with the username and password set up on Github. The account is only needed if an individual wants to commit something onto Github. Otherwise, to clone a public project, a Github account is not needed. This is important to learn since I am just getting familiar with both committing onto a repository and using secure shell.
